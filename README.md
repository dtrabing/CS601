## This Repo represents all of work done for the CS601 class I took in the summer of 2023

All assignments completed have been uploaded here as well as the final project for the class. 

## Final Project

### Project Proposal:

For the director of a small speech and occupational therapy clinic, we would like to create an application that leverages the JDBC API to schedule therapy appointments for patients. The application needs to store all members with their name and contact information, as well as store the therapists information, including their name and specialization. The application will also need to store all reserved appointments. The application will need to be able to book an appointment for a patient and therapist, and ensure that the appointment does not overlap with any previous appointments for either patient or therapist. 

To keep scope down, we will not go beyond the above goal.

Below is a first draft of the UML diagram and Entity Relationship Diagram for this application.

### Project Implementation:

Because of the amount of work it took to correctly build all of the different classes and methods needed to enable the above use case, the scope changed to manually instantiate data, instead of leveraging a database.
